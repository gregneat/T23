Hey Everybody! Danny here

I just wanted to talk briefly about my unity game, Crappybird.

Obviously, this is a ripoff of flappy bird, hence the name. It took me about two weeks to make.
While a simple game, over my development period, I had to do a large amount of research and struggled with many bugs.
Among other things, I had issues with:

Trees randomly dissapearing
Gravity not working
Positions not working
Objects not pausing
Text objects deleting themselves.

Furthermore, I didnt know how to do the majority of things necessary to make this game. I had to do a lot of research,
and, more importantly, I had to find my own solutions to issues.

Making games in unity is difficult. It can be tedious, confusing, and downright annoying, but the satisfaction of creating
even a game as simple as this, will make it all worthwhile. Sometimes you may encounter issues you have no idea how to
solve, but eventually, with enough dedication, you can do anything. Good luck everyone! =)

Controls are as follows:
Click on play to... play.
Space allows you to flap. Be careful, this is physics based. If you are falling quickly, you may need to flap twice.
R allows you to restart the game. The start is preset, but everything else is unique!
